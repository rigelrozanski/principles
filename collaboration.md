# Collaboration

I will work with <ins>absolutely anyone</ins> who agrees to the following
principles of collaboration:

1. Moving forward you agree towards orienting yourself towards all expressible,
   conveyable, and understandable truth. 
2. Your competitors, enemies, and/or adversaries remain external and detached
   from our collaboration, you will in no manner pressure, jeopardize, nor
   coerce our collaboration on the basis of who else I choose to collaborate with. 
3. Where unrectifiable conflicts of interest arise, all collaborators will
   explicitly identify the limitations of our collaboration and what forms of
   information are to be excluded from communications such that
   goodwill, integrity, and appropriate confidentiality can be maintained. 
4. If I'm tossing a rave and you're nearby, you'll try to pop by. 

If collaboration is mutually agreed upon then an expectation of mutual
adherence to the principles immediately begins. Demonstrated failure to
adhere to these principles may result in an on the spot conclusion of the
collaboration.  

Collaboration in this regard is neither predicated on having a working
relationship of the exchange of work and/or money, nor is it predicated on
having any particular project of which to form the basis of the collaboration.
Here, collaboration is referred to as the willingness to work together and
support each other whenever reasonable.
